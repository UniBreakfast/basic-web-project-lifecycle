Here I ruminate on steps before adding them into index.html

Step 0
  Create GitHub repository
  Clone it on my computer
  Create a gonnabe.txt with the brief description of a project (<1page)

Step 1
  Make first commit/push to GitHub
  Make a simple vector sketch.svg to illustrate the project vision
  Make another commit/push. Do another one at the end of each Step

Step 2
  Create an index.html in project root folder as an entry point
  Create a style.css in project root folder for basic styling
  Create a script.js in project root folder for general page scripting

Step 3
  Define stack of technologies to be used in a project (minimal)
  Define list of distinct entities in a system (minimal)
  List the tasks that need to be done as they seem to be relevant right now (7 max on top level)

Step 4
  Describe general page algorytm (simplified procedure for the first page only)
  Write it in pseudocode
  Fake it for the first try-testing by hand

Step 5
  If couldn't keep myself from "going with the flow", describe relevant steps I made
  Revert changes I made
  Redo them by written description

Step 6
  Pick a task from the list of tasks made on a step 2
  Split it in moves
  And do them separately commit by commit

Step 7
  Do the same with other tasks
  Make changes as the need arises BUT only after adding them to the tasks
